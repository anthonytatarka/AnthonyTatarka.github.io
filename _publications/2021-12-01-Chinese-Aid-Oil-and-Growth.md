I use data on Chinese foreign aid from AidDataâ€™s Global Chinese Development Finance Dataset to study the impacts of foreign aid on recipient countries economies. To account for possible reverse causality or omitted variable bias, I use lagged Chinese steel production interacted with a indicator for recipient countries having oil reserves as an instrument for Chinese foriegn aid. The rationale for this instrument is that when China has extra steel production they will be more likely to create foreign aid projects in which they can use their excess steel and they will target these projects to countries with oil reserves which are seen as a strategic natural resource. I argue that this creates exogenous variation in foriegn aid, although there may be problems with the exclusion restriction because oil reserves may be correlated with the economic outcomes of recipient countries. I find that countries who recieve Chinese foriegn aid have higher GDPs per capita two years after the foreign aid is recieved. Looking into heterogenous effects of different types of foriegn aid, I find that more traditional foreign aid in line with OECD standards causes higher GDP growth rates but lower GDP per capita while more commercially oriented aid causes has no effect on GDP growth but increases GDP per capita.
