The Montana hunting permit market organized by Montana Fish, Wildlife and
Parks is an important market for allocating permissions to hunt. In this paper, I study
the current hunting permit lottery and the probabilities of winning the permit lotteries
and evaluate the pros and cons of the market. I then propose two versions of VCG
auctions which could potentially be improvements to the current system. I recommend
the use of my created VCG Version 1 auction for permits due to its efficient allocation
and relative ease of participant use, although its computational viability needs to be
investigated further.
