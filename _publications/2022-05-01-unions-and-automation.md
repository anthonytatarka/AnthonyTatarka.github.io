In this paper we examine the effects of labor unions on the adoption of automation
using a difference-in-difference approach utilizing variation in Midwest states adopting
Right-to-Work (RTW) laws. We find that RTW states have on average 0.3361 more
robots per thousand workers than non-RTW states, which is significant at the 1% level.
Since RTW laws are a proxy for weaker unions, this suggests that unions decrease
automation; however, this estimate is not casual due to problems with the parallel
trends assumption and non-exogenous adoption of RTW laws.
