I study the effects of welfare time limits which were introduced as a major change to
welfare in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act and their effect
on welfare use. I use variation in states timing and length of welfare time constraints
to use a difference-in-difference model, estimating the effects of an “Effective Time
Limit” which is a measure of the remaining years of welfare eligibility, taking into
account both time limits and age of youngest child. I find that a one year increase in
the effective time limit increases welfare use by 1.88 percentage points and number of
months of welfare use in a given year by 0.206 on average. These findings suggest quite
substantial effects of welfare time limits on welfare use.
