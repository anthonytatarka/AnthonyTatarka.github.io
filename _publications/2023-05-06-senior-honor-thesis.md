I study a 1983 New Jersey Supreme Court Decision known as Mt. Laurel II which
created “Builder’s Remedy”, allowing developers to sue municipalities that deny per-
mits for residential construction as long as the proposed projects meet certain afford-
ability requirements. This gives developers a legal threat to bypass local zoning codes
to build more and different types of housing where they previously could not. I study
this policy’s effect on housing supply, measured by permits for residential buildings
and units. To get a causal estimate, I use a difference-in-difference strategy comparing
towns close to the border in New Jersey to towns in New York and Pennsylvania. I
find that the Mt. Laurel II policy increased total buildings permitted by 13% and total
units permitted by 14% on average for towns in New Jersey compared to the control
group, using my preferred specification
