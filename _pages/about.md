My name is Anthony Tatarka and I am a Predoc working for Professor Bruce Meyer's Comprehensive Income Dataset (CID) team. I am currently applying to graduate economics programs.


## Background and Interests
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2023 with a B.S in Mathematics and Economics. While at Notre Dame, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the Wilson-Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunity (LEO). I also was a TA for an econometrics course taught by Professor A. Nilesh Fernando.

I am intersted in applied microeconomics research to study poverty and those in need.
