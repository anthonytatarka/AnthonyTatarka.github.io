My name is Anthony Tatarka and I am applying to graduate economics programs. In my current role, I am a predoc at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy working for Professor Bruce D. Meyer's Comprehensive Income Dataset (CID) team.


## Background and Interests
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2023 with a B.S in Mathematics and Economics. While at Notre Dame, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the Wilson-Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunity (LEO) working on randomized controlled trials to understand the causal effects of programs and services to help those in poverty. In addition to undergraduate research, I was a TA for an econometrics course taught by Professor A. Nilesh Fernando.

I am intersted in the fields of labor and public economics. I plan on studying poverty, inequality, and understanding how government programs and policies can be used to help those in need.
